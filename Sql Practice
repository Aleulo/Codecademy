 /* Start by getting a feel for the hacker_news table! 
 
 select title, score, timestamp from hacker_news
 order by score desc
 limit 5 ;

 Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule).

Is this true of Hacker News?

Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?
 select sum(score) from hacker_news;

Next, we need to pinpoint the users who have accumulated a lot of points across their stories.
Find the individual users who have gotten combined scores of more than 200, and their combined scores.
select user, sum(score) from hacker_news
group by 1
having sum(score) > 200;

Then, we want to add these users’ scores together and divide by the total to get the percentage.
Add their scores together and divide it by the total sum. Like so:

Select user, score from hacker_news
where score > 200;

SELECT (517 + 309 + 304 + 282) / 6366.0;

select user, count(*) from hacker_news 
group by 1
having url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ';

Hacker News stories are essentially links that take users to other websites.
Which of these sites feed Hacker News the most:
GitHub, Medium, or New York Times?
First, we want to categorize each story based on their source.
We can do this using a CASE statement:

select user, url,
case 
  When url like '%github.com%' then 'GitHub'
  when url like '%medium.com%' then 'Medium'
  when url like '%nytimes.com%' then 'New York Times'
  Else 'Other'
End as 'Source'
From hacker_news
where url is not null;


select count(*),
case 
  When url like '%github.com%' then 'GitHub'
  when url like '%medium.com%' then 'Medium'
  when url like '%nytimes.com%' then 'New York Times'
  Else 'Other'
End as 'Source'
From hacker_news
group by Source;


-- Which sites feed Hacker News?

SELECT CASE
   WHEN url LIKE '%github.com%' THEN 'GitHub'
   WHEN url LIKE '%medium.com%' THEN 'Medium'
   WHEN url LIKE '%nytimes.com%' THEN 'New York Times'
   ELSE 'Other'
  END AS 'Source',
  COUNT(*)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1;


Every submitter wants their story to get a high score so that the story makes it to the front page, but…

What’s the best time of the day to post a story on Hacker News?

Before we get started, let’s run this query and take a look at the timestamp column:

select timestamp 
from hacker_news
limit 10;


SELECT timestamp,
   strftime('%H', timestamp)
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 2
LIMIT 20;

SELECT strftime('%H', timestamp) AS 'Hour',
  ROUND(AVG(score), 1) AS 'Average Score',
  COUNT(*) AS 'Number of Stories'
FROM hacker_news
GROUP BY 1
;
